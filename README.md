I chose the question "Is it rude to ask someone to switch seats with you in order to be closer to family?" because I think it’s interesting to see how people perceive switching seats for family versus for friends, since we tend to prioritize family more. 
Although I wasn’t able to compare it with responses about switching seats for friends, the data shows that most people are willing to switch so someone can sit closer to their family.
